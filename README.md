**Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Network**

Install TensorFlow:
Install TensorFlow using pip install tensorflow.
Import Libraries:
Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
Load and Preprocess Data:
Load the MNIST dataset.
Normalize the data by scaling pixel values to the range 0-1.
Reshape the data if necessary (for example, flattening the images).
Define and Compile the Model:
Define a Sequential model.
Add layers to the model:
Flatten layer to convert 2D images to 1D vectors.
Dense layers with activation functions.
Optionally, add Batch Normalization layers after Dense layers to improve training.
Compile the model with an optimizer (e.g., SGD or Adam), loss function (e.g., sparse_categorical_crossentropy), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Setup Callbacks:
Set up TensorBoard callback to log training metrics.
Train the Model:
Train the model using the fit method, specifying the number of epochs and callbacks.
Evaluate the Model:
Evaluate the model on the test dataset using the evaluate method.
Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
Convert the predicted probabilities to class labels.
Generate Confusion Matrix:
Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.
Visualize Results:
Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot the confusion matrix and sample predictions.
Example Workflow:
Initial Model: Start with a simple neural network with only input and output layers.
Improvement: Add a hidden layer to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
Batch Normalization: Include Batch Normalization layers to further improve training stability and performance.
By following these steps, you can build, train, and evaluate a neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
